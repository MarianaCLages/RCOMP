# 2. Subtasks assessment #
One by one, each team member presents his/her outcomes to the team, the team assesses 		the accomplishment of the subtask backlog.
The subtask backlog accomplishment can be assessed as one of:

  * Totally implemented with no issues
  * Totally implemented with issues
  * Partially implemented with no issues
  * Partially implemented with issues


### 2.1. 1200920 - Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building one, encompassing the campus backbone. Integration of every member’s Packet Tracer simulation into a single simulation. #
* Totally implemented with no issues.


### 2.2. 1200902 - Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building two, encompassing the campus backbone.
* Totally implemented with no issues.


### 2.3. 1200601 - Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building three, encompassing the campus backbone.
* Totally implemented with no issues.


### 2.4. 1201487 - Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building four, encompassing the campus backbone.
