# 2. Technical decisions and coordination #
In this section, all technical decisions taken in the planning meeting should be mentioned. 		Most importantly, all technical decisions impacting on the subtasks implementation must be settled on this 		meeting and specified here.

In this sprint, the team needs to work on the tasks only using the campus.pkt file. However, each team member must also commit to the **personal sprint folder a text file with a configuration dump
for every switch and for every router within the encompassed building. These configuration text files can
be easily exported in Packet Tracer: within the device’s window click the export button on the Running
Config, or the Startup Config (if the Running Config has been saved).**



##DNS Domain

One DNS domain is going to be established on each building.

The team member in charge of building 1 will create a DNS domain name matching the team’s repository
name (rcomp-21-22-cc-gn). This is going to be the highest-level domain, so it’s going to be used as
if it was the DNS root domain.

DNS name for the remaining members: **building-X.rcomp-21-22-cc-gn**

With **X** replaced by the digit that identifies the building (i.e., 2, 3, 4, and 5).

###Notes:

Since we are a team of four members a DNS for the fifth building won't be developed.
