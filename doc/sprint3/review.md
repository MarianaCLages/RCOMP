| T.3.1 | Update the building1.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 1                                                                                                    |
| T.3.2 | Update the building2.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 2. Final integration of each member's Packet Tracer simulation into a single simulation (campus.pkt) |
| T.3.3 | Update the building3.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 3                                                                                                    |

# 2. Subtasks assessment #
One by one, each team member presents his/her outcomes to the team, the team assesses 		the accomplishment of the subtask backlog.
The subtask backlog accomplishment can be assessed as one of:

* Partially implemented with no issues
* Partially implemented with no issues
* Partially implemented with no issues
* Partially implemented with no issues

For the last three cases, a text description of what has not been implemented and present issues must be added.
Unimplemented features and issues solving is assigned to the same member on the next sprint.



### 2.1. 1200920 - Development of OSPF,HTTP,DHCP,VoIP service,DNS,NAT and ACL. #
* All ICMP echo requests and echo replies are always allowed. **- not implemmented**
* All traffic to the DMZ is to be blocked, except for the DNS service
and HTTP/HTTPS services to the corresponding servers. All traffic
incomming from the DMZ is allowed. **- not implemmented**
* All traffic directed to the router itself (with destination IPV4 node
address belonging to the router) is to be blocked, except for the traffic
required for the current to work **- not implemmented**
* Remaning traffic, except for the traffic required for the current
features to work **- not implemmented.**

  address belonging to the router) is to be blocked, except for the traffic
  required for the current to work **- not implemmented**
